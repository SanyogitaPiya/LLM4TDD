Test Single Element Array:

Input: [5]
Expected Output: [5]
Assertion: The result of code26([5]) should have a length equal to the length of the expected output, and each element should match.
Test All Unique Elements:

Input: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Expected Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Assertion: The result of code26([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) should have a length equal to the length of the expected output, and each element should match.
Test All Duplicate Elements:

Input: [3, 3, 3, 3]
Expected Output: [3]
Assertion: The result of code26([3, 3, 3, 3]) should have a length equal to the length of the expected output, and each element should match.
Test Duplicates at Beginning:

Input: [2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Expected Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
Assertion: The result of code26([2, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should have a length equal to the length of the expected output, and each element should match.
Test Duplicates at End:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
