# RQ5: How does the test prompt template impact the performance of LLM4TDD?. 

**Text Descriptions**LLM4TDD requires more prompts to generate code when the
test is given as a textual description. It is useful to give contex-
tual information about forbidden usage of libraries or resources
but it is not recommended to use plain text instead of test code.


**Appending to a Meta-Test.**
The absence of direct replication from online sources suggests
that ChatGPT may be producing these recurring failing solu-
tions based on learned patterns from its training data, rather
than directly extracting them from existing solutions
